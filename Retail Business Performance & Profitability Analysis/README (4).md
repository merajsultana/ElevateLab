## üß™ Mini Guide: How to Replicate the Analysis

### 1. **Data Acquisition**
- Start with `Sample - Superstore (1).csv` as your raw data.

### 2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation (Python)**
- Open `EDA_and_Correlation (1).ipynb`
- Run the first cell to:
  - Load raw CSV
  - Clean date columns (`Order Date`, `Ship Date`)
  - Save as `Cleaned_Superstore_Dates.csv`

### 3. **SQL Data Import and Analysis (SQLite)**
- In the same notebook, run the final cell to:
  - Create in-memory SQLite DB
  - Load `Cleaned_Superstore_Dates.csv`
  - Run SQL query to compute `Profit_Margin` by Category/Sub-Category
  - Save as `category_profitability.csv`

### 4. **Python EDA and Correlation**
- Run remaining notebook cells to:
  - Inspect data (head, columns, nulls)
  - Engineer time-based features (Year, Month, Quarter, Order_Month)
  - Group and analyze profits
  - Simulate inventory metrics
  - Visualize trends and correlation heatmaps

### 5. **Tableau Dashboard Development**
- Open `Retail_Business_Performance_Project.twb` in Tableau Desktop
- Ensure it connects to `Cleaned_Superstore_Dates.csv`
- Explore filters: Region, Product Type, Season

## üìä Key Insights and Strategic Suggestions

### üîç Insights
- **Profit Drainers**: "Tables" and "Bookcases" show consistent negative margins.
- **Seasonal Peaks**: Sales surge during Q4, ideal for targeted campaigns.
- **Discount-Profit Correlation**: Negative impact suggests discounting needs strategy.

### ‚úÖ Strategic Suggestions
- **Re-evaluate Unprofitable Products**: Consider bundling or replacement.
- **Optimize Inventory**: Use data insights to clear overstock and improve turnover.
- **Leverage Seasonality**: Focus on high-performing categories during Oct‚ÄìDec.
- **Smarter Discounts**: Value-added deals > blanket price cuts.
- **Region-Specific Strategy**: Utilize Tableau dashboard insights for regional plans.
